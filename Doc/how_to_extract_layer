#update :    
As of Docker 1.10, image layer IDs do not correspond to the names of the directories that contain their data



1. use xdelta to get the binay diff.

  - frist user 'docker save ' get these two images. [docker export will lost the environment information]
  - xdelta compare...

2. image layers  locate in /var/lib/docker/diff/[image id]/

  for each layer, we need get :

     layer info:
         Json file: /var/lib/docker/graph
         layer tar file: /var/lib/docker/aufs/diff
         version :   1.0


    and also we need the repositories file.
