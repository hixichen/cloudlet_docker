AUFS (Another Union File System) is an advanced multi-layered unification filesystem. Aufs was originally a re-design and re-implementation of the popular UnionFS, however after adding many new original ideas it became entirely separate from UnionFS. Aufs is considered a UnionFS alternative since it supports many of the same features.


overlayFS:
Note: The OverlayFS filesystem was merged into the upstream Linux kernel 3.18 and is now Docker's preferred filesystem (instead of AUFS). However, there is a bug in OverlayFS that reports the wrong mnt_id in /proc/<pid>/fdinfo/<fd> and the wrong symlink target path for /proc/<pid>/<fd>. Fortunately, these bugs have been fixed in the kernel v4.2-rc2.
